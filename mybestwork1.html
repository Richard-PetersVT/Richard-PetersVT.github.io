  Vermont Foliage LTA Assignment
 The assessment was fall foliage, it was a 2 month-long project where we had to go outside and take pictures of fall foliage. I did this project because it was an assignment in CAWD 2. I did enjoy taking pictures. It was fun. I'm proud of myself for being able to get the pictures I need for the assignment. Mostly it took that long because I had work and had to get driven to places for the pictures.
The Steps
Get A Camera 
Drive the places I went for pictures like Bristol
Get the camera in focus 
Take the picture 
Upload it on the computer and enhance the images 

Next, I got the camera from my teacher in CAWD 2. Took my camera home to make time to start. I drove to Bristol to take pictures on the way and put the camera in focus each time. After taking pictures, put them on the computer and edit them to make them look better and pick the one I like.

I wish I had started on it earlier than I did to get pictures of when fall was at its peak. I tried to get more pictures of trees. I think going to different places than just Bristol would have helped a bit. In conclusion, it was a pretty long project but I had fun while doing it. I would do a project like this again.
