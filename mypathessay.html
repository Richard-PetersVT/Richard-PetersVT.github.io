        <h1>My path after high school</h1>

        <p class="container">

I first learned of Center For Technology from a classmate at Champlain Valley Union High School and I applied to Pre-tech 2. Now I am in Computer Animation and Web Design 2 which I am enjoying. School before coming to the Center for Technology was very boring and challenging for me. Some of it was because of COVID-19 for sure but I think the classes were not engaging for me and not hands-on, which made things more tough for me. People who have been influential to me are my friends and my grandma who have helped me be a better person and all around have helped me with life. I am very thankful to have these people in my life.

I am a part-time worker at CVS as I go to school. I balance my schedule so I can focus on school while working.I chose this program because I like computers and also it was something I have always been interested in. I have loved the program and I have fun while doing it. Also, the teachers and students are nice and easy to get along with!  



<br>




I think that I’m a good worker and student. I’m always respectful and I always get the job done. Work Completion and Behaving with respect are very important transferable skills that everyone should have not just for school but work, too! They are important because you always need respect no matter what job or place you are and of course, any job will want you to have your work completed. I am leaving school with the skills to make models for games and web design coding skills to make a website and will be able to find a job that is fit for my skill set.

After High School, I plan to move to a full-time position at my current job while exploring other job opportunities. For example, I am interested in web design and development as well as a career in plumbing or as an electrician or I could do something with fixing computers. Those fields pay well. Ultimately I’d like to make enough money to start my own business. There are a lot of things I’d like to do in my future and I’d like to make enough money to make it happen such as buying a car to remodel it or buying my dream car those are just some things.
